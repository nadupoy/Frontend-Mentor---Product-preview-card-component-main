## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### Project workflow

- I took this as an exercise to assess myself on how quick my turnaround would be.
I managed to complete the project in just below 5 hours.

- While using VS Code, I started using the vertical rulers,
setting the character limit at 80 to avoid extra long lines of code which are
not recommended practice.

### What I learned
- How to set vertical rulers in VS Code.
[This](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/do-you-know-about-rulers-in-visual-studio-code-f754b221a135)
article provided a clear step-by-step process on how to do so.
<br>
It was through this article that I was introduced to working with `settings.json`
in VS Code settings, implementing it as shown below:
```json
{
  ...
  "editor.rulers": [80],
  ...
}
```

- I implemented splitting my code to a horizontal limit of 80 characters as
explained [here](https://javascript.info/coding-style#line-length).

### Continued development

- Working with `.json` files.
